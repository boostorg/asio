[section:examples Examples]


[heading Allocation]

This example shows how to customise the allocation of memory associated with
asynchronous operations.

[heading Buffers]

This example demonstrates how to create reference counted buffers that can be
used with socket read and write operations.

[heading Chat]

This example implements a chat server and client. The programs use a custom
protocol with a fixed length message header and variable length message body.

and asynchronous operations.

[heading HTTP Client]

Example programs implementing simple HTTP 1.0 clients. These examples show how
to use the [link boost_asio.reference.read_until] and [link
boost_asio.reference.async_read_until] functions.

This example illustrates the use of asio in a simple single-threaded server
implementation of HTTP 1.0. It demonstrates how to perform a clean shutdown by
cancelling all outstanding asynchronous operations.

* [@../../example/http/server/connection.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server/connection.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server/connection_manager.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server/connection_manager.hpp]

* [@../../example/http/server/request_handler.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server/request_parser.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server/request_parser.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server/server.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server/server.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server/win_main.cpp]


[heading HTTP Server 2]

An HTTP server using an io_service-per-CPU design.

* [@../../example/http/server2/connection.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/connection.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/header.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/io_service_pool.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/io_service_pool.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/mime_types.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/mime_types.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/posix_main.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/reply.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/reply.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/request.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/request_handler.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/request_handler.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/request_parser.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/request_parser.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/server.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/server.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server2/win_main.cpp]


[heading HTTP Server 3]

An HTTP server using a single io_service and a thread pool calling `io_service::run()`.

* [@../../example/http/server3/connection.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server3/connection.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server3/header.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server3/mime_types.cpp]
* [@../../example/http/server3/mime_types.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server3/posix_main.cpp]

* [@../../example/http/server3/server.hpp]
* [@../../example/http/server3/win_main.cpp]


[heading Invocation]

This example shows how to customise handler invocation. Completion handlers are
added to a priority queue rather than executed immediately.

* [@../../example/invocation/prioritised_handlers.cpp]


[heading Iostreams]

for logging) into asio's [link boost_asio.reference.io_service io_service], and
how to use a custom service with [link
